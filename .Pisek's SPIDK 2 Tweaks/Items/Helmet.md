## Repairing
### Grinding

| Ingredients       | Grinding recipe                   | Note                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2x Damaged Helmet | [[matching_armor_grinding.png]] | The durability of the two helmets is added together, plus an extra 5% durability. |

### Unit repair

Helmets can be repaired in an [anvil](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Anvil "Anvil") by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25 % of the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down.

# Usage

Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's [inventory](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") for activation.

## Defense points

Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the number of defense points added by helmets.

| Material | Defense points | 
| -------- | -------------- |
| Wooden   | 2              |
| Leaf     | 1              |

## Durability

The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as [falling](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Fall_damage "Damage") or [drowning](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Drowning "Damage")) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

| Material | Durability |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Wooden   | 110        |
| Leaf     | 11         | 

### Repair

Helmets may be [repaired](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Item_repair "Item repair") by using them along with some of their crafting material (leaves, logs) in an [anvil](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Anvil "Anvil"). They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another helmet of like material.

## Enchantments

A helmet can receive the following [enchantments](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchantment "Enchantment"):
