| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2x Damaged Leggings | [[matching_armor_grinding.png]] | The durability of the two leggings are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. |

### Unit repair

Leggings can be repaired on an [anvil](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Anvil "Anvil") by combining them with their corresponding crafting material (leaves, logs), with each repair material restoring 25 % of the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Any enchantments are retained. Leggings may also be repaired by crafting them together with another pair of leggings of the same material, although enchantments are lost.

# Usage

Leggings can be placed in the 3rd armor slot of a player's [inventory](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") for activation.

## Defense points

Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4 %, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the number of defense points added by leggings.

| Material | Defense points |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Wooden   | 3              |
| Leaf     | 1              |

## Durability

The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as [falling](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Fall_damage "Damage") or [drowning](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Drowning "Damage")) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. he following chart displays how many hits leggings can endure.

| Material | Durability |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Wooden   | 150        |
| Leaf     | 15         | 

## Enchantments

Leggings can receive the following [enchantments](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchantment "Enchantment"):
