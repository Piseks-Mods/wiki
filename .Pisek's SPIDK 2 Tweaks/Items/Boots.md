| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2x Damaged Bootss | [[matching_armor_grinding.png]] | The durability of the two boots are added together, plus an extra 5 % durability. |

### Unit repair

Boots can be repaired in an [anvil](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Anvil "Anvil") by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25 % of the boots' maximum durability, rounded down.

# Usage

Boots can be placed in the fourth armor slot of a player's [inventory](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") for activation.

## Defense points

Defense points are each signified by half of a chestplate in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4 %, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the amount of defense points added by boots.

| Material   | Defense points |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Wooden     | 1              |
| Leaf       | 1              |
| Cum-filled | 1              | 

## Durability

The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as [falling](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Fall_damage "Damage") or [drowning](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Drowning "Damage")) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits boots can endure.

| Material   | Durability |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Wooden     | 130        |
| Leaf       | 13         |
| Cum-filled | 65         | 

## Enchantments

Boots can receive the following [enchantments](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchantment "Enchantment"):
