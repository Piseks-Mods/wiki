The **daylight cycle** is a 20-minute-long cycle between two main [light](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light "Light") settings.

One every 20 minutes, one day, is added to the day counter. Sleeping does not add any time, however it doesn't stop the clocks either.

# Watch

Watches allows the player to determine the current _player's_ time. Very useful when waiting for some key time frame.

# Commands

Every player can get its own day count, as `/day` command does not require any permissions.

## Get days

Current day count can be obtained with the `/day get` command. _(Or using just `/day`)_

## Reset days

Be careful when using this command, it will set the day counter to 0. This can be useful for obtaining another [[Music Disc|Music Disc Patn√°ctiny]].

Syntax: `/day reset`
