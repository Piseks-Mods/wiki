Welcome to the *Švísk Písk IDK 2 Tweaks* wiki, a publicly accessible wiki.

# Current version

**Švísk Písk IDK 2 Tweaks 2.1** is taking place after `2.0t2` adding more mechanics and content.

# Discontinued versions

**Švísk Písk IDK 2 Tweaks 2.0t2** is an open-source recreation of the original SPIKD2 2.0 which was lost during Pisek's computer reinstallation. The "t2" stands for "Take 2" marking it's almost the same as the original, but better. Some of the mechanics were scrapped, improved and new were added.
